# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2019 in Go

## Running

All files are in the main package, so you need to explicitly reference them when running:

```bash
$ go run ./day4.go
```

or when running tests, you have to include both the file you want to test and the test itself:

```bash
$ go test -v ./day4*.go
```
